In this repository i will try and visualise what it would look like if the universe was made of simple oscilating points that osilated between push and pull. The field they exist in is scalar.

Personal notesx:

I have 2 dimensions (in software)
 1. State
 2. Acceleration
Acceleration is the value of change from one statte to the other.
State is the snapshot of what accelation is in the middle of doing

Just realised the acceleration is divided by the distance from source.
But the universe must work inn more simple terms.
The scalar fliend must interact consistiently. Which is hard to imagine,

1 = push
-1 = pull

Every point in the N dimentional plane must elasticate to this behavour.

Too tired and rink to put this into code just yet. The code i have doesnt describe it just right.
Will get back to this ..
